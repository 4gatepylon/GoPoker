# Construction
## Building
Make sure you have Bazel and Golang installed.
Run `go get google.golang.org/grpc`. (I use GRPC to communicate. Bazel is the build tool btw, it's great.)

Test with Bazel's test and build with bazel's build. There should be executables for client and server in the bazel directories for you to run.
